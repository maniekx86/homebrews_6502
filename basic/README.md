# BASIC

All modified files in my local copy of the [mist64/msbasic](https://github.com/mist64/msbasic) repo. I don't remember what does what, so I decided to just upload them all. The most interesting file is pcb6502.s, which contains the source code for the in/out routines for my prototype PCB version 6502 computer. In theory, you can compile this by copying these files to the msbasic repository and running make.sh with as65 installed.
