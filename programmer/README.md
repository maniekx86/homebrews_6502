# Programmer

Code for my custom programmer that I used when I first started working with homebrew computers. Can work with 2816 and later was modded to work with 28256 too (by writing only the half 16K at once as I was out of pins on Arduino)

- 2816programmer: Directory with CodeBlock source for a nice GUI tool,
- programmer_2816: Directory with Arduino source

Unfortunately, I don't have the schematics for this programmer, and the PCB was desoldered and reused for another purpose. If you want to reuse this project, try modifying the Arduino source code to meet your needs.
